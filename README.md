* As you click the middle button on the bottom navigation bar, you'll get to the screen where the app start speaking and receiving your voice order. I used uzbek text-to-speech API and android's RecognizerIntent for recognizing user speech

* Finally on the last page you can see the orders that you made in the second page and finalize your orders
